    <h2>Then</h2>
    <p>
        It was upon a Sommers shynie day,<br>
        When Titan faire his beames did display,<br>
        In a fresh fountaine, farre from all mens vew,<br>
        She bath'd her brest, the boyling heat t'allay;<br>
        She bath'd with roses red, and violets blew,<br>
        And all the sweetest flowres, that in the forrest grew.
    </p>
    <h2>Now</h2>
    <p>
        Roses are red,<br>
        Violets are blue,<br>
        Sugar is sweet,<br>
        And so are you.
